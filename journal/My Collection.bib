abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

We present an algorithm designed for data-parallel computing on modern graphics processing units to alleviate the computational burden. We apply Gaussian interpolation to create a continuous surface representation from discrete input object points. The algorithm maintains a potential occluder list for each individual hologram plane sample to keep the number of visibility tests to a minimum. We experimented with two approximations that simplify and accelerate occlusion computation. It is observed that letting several neighboring hologram plane samples share visibility information on object points leads to significantly faster computation without causing noticeable artifacts in the reconstructed images. Computing a reduced sample set via nonuniform sampling is also found to be an effective acceleration technique. },

High-quality, digital single-lens reflex cameras are used to acquire the depth and color information from real scenes; these are then virtually reconstructed by the uniform point cloud using a non-uniform sampling method. The C-PCG method is proposed to generate efficient depth grids by classifying groups of object points with the same depth values in the red, green, and blue channels. Holograms are obtained by applying fast Fourier transform diffraction calculations to the grids. Compared to wave-front recording plane methods, the quality of the reconstructed images is substantially better, and the computational complexity is dramatically reduced.

abstract = {A grating projection shape measurement system has been a commonly used method in the field of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction in recent years, and global point cloud registration is a key step in this method. However, in the registration process, a large amount of low-precision overlapping redundant data (ORD) is generated between adjacent camera stations, which will seriously affect the speed and accuracy of later modeling. Therefore, how to eliminate these low-precision ORD is a major problem to be solved at present. Determining all overlapping 3D point pairs between two adjacent stations and deleting the points with low precision in the point pairs is the key to solving this problem. Therefore, based on an omnidirectional rotation measurement system, combined with the constraint relationships between the projection space and the acquisition space in the global registration process and the stereo-matching method of space conversion, an elimination algorithm for ORD with a two-dimensional (2D) phase constraint and a 2D pixel constraint is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can faster locate overlapping 3D point pairs between adjacent stations, with a higher elimination rate, and the accuracy of the overall point cloud is higher after the redundancy elimination. },

abstract = {Fast two-step layer-based and sub-sparse two-dimensional Fast Fourier transform (SS-2DFFT) algorithms are proposed to speed up the calculation of computer-generated holograms. In a layer-based method, each layer image may contain large areas in which the pixel values are zero considering the occlusion effect among the different depth layers. By taking advantage of this feature, the two-step layer-based algorithm only calculates the non-zero image areas of each layer. In addition, the SS-2DFFT method implements two one-dimensional fast Fourier transforms (1DFFT) to compute a 2DFFT without calculating the rows or columns in which the image pixels are all zero. Since the size of the active calculation is reduced, the computational speed is considerably improved. Numerical simulations and optical experiments are performed to confirm these methods. The results show that the total computational time can be reduced by 5 times for a three-dimensional (3D) object of a train, 3.4 times for a 3D object of a castle and 10 times for a 3D object of a statue head when compared with a conventional layer-based method if combining the two proposed methods together. },

abstract = {Head-up displays (HUDs) are used in aircraft to overlay relevant flight information on the vehicle's externals for pilots to view with continued focus on the far field. In these systems, the field of view (FOV) is traditionally limited by the size of the projection optics. Though classical HUD systems take a significant amount of space in the flight deck, they have become a necessity in avionic transportation. Our research aims to reduce the size of the HUD footprint while offering a wide FOV projected in the far field with an expanded pupil. This has been accomplished by coupling the image-bearing light into a waveguide under total internal reflection conditions, redirecting that light in the orthogonal direction, and then outcoupling the light toward the pilot. Each step was achieved using holographic optical elements. The injection hologram has optical power to obtain longitudinal magnification, whereas the redirection hologram expands the pupil in one dimension and the extraction hologram expands the pupil in a second dimension. Varying diffraction efficiency along the direction of the light propagation ensures even image intensity throughout the expanded pupil. We used ray tracing optical simulations to optimize the design of the system and present a fully operational demonstrator of the HUD. This HUD produces an image with a FOV of 24°×12.6° at a viewing distance of 4.5 in. (114 mm) from the waveguide, with infinite longitudinal magnification and 1.9× by 1.6× horizontal and vertical pupil expansion, respectively. },

abstract = {In the big data era, the necessity for large capacity, high transfer rates and long-term data storage systems has been increased. But, the main storage media we rely on currently are magnetic technology, like hard disk drives (HDD) and tape, which life times are several years only. They cannot satisfy the demand of prolonged preservation. Optical discs based on the bit-by-bit method, such as CD, DVD and Blu-ray Disc, for storing sound, movies, photos and other digital contents are widely used in our daily life. The long-term life time is one of the properties. The optical disc should be a good candidate of data storage system for big data preservation. However, the recording density limitation of the bit recording method are looming on the horizon. },

A generalized mathematical description of OSH that takes into account polarization effects, high numerical apertures, and generalized illumination wave fronts is presented. This description is used to show that the proposed single-beam scanning technique relaxes the restrictions under which OSH functions correctly compared with the conventional double-beam scanning method. It is also shown that, although in general OSH is restricted to thin samples, this condition can be relaxed in nonrefracting fluorescence samples, which are of importance in biological microscopy. },

abstract = {Holography is an optics technique based on wave physics and lasers with several applications at our day life. The production of holograms involves experimental work based on hands-on activities and creativity. All these elements can contribute to the promotion of experimental teaching of optics and training on holography. The hologram itself acting as a final result from a long process of research and study can enable the engagement of high school students on physics and promote the stimulus on optics learning. Taking these assumptions into account a network of schools working on holography was built involving thirty schools from all country. Holography systems were developed and several handson activities were constructed. During last sixteen years students are working on laser optics and holography producing different kinds of holograms. This study presents all holography labs implemented at schools and it will analyzed the holography systems and materials developed for students. Training strategy will be discussed and holograms obtained by students will be presented. Results obtained show us that holography can be implemented as a strategy for promoting the learning of optics and it is a particular way to involve students on experimental work and lab research. Results obtained during this study will be presented in detail and analyzed with focus on students performance.

abstract = {In microscopy, high magnifications are achievable for investigating micro-objects but the paradigm is that higher is the required magnification, lower is the depth of focus. For an object having a three-dimensional (3D) complex shape only a portion of it appears in good focus to the observer who is essentially looking at a single image plane. Actually, two approaches exist to obtain an extended focused image, both having severe limitations since the first requires mechanical scanning while the other one requires specially designed optics. We demonstrate that an extended focused image of an object can be obtained through digital holography without any mechanical scanning or special optical components. The conceptual novelty of the proposed approach lies in the fact that it is possible to completely exploit the unique feature of DH in extracting all the information content stored in hologram, amplitude and phase, to extend the depth of focus. },

In the experiment, multiplexing holographic recording and readout is based on Bragg selectivity of volume holographic grating, in which Bragg diffraction angle is dependent on grating-recording angel. By using different interference angle between reference and object beams, the holograms can be recorded into photorefractive crystal, and then the object images can be read out from these holograms via angular addressing by using the original reference beam.

New generations of cell phones are now equipped with text messaging, internet, and camera features. They are now making their way into the classroom.

Because of the many benefits that cell phones offer, teachers could easily use them as a teaching and learning tool. However, an additional work from the teachers for introducing their students into the m-Learning in the classroom needs to be defined and developed. As an example, optical techniques, based upon interference and diffraction phenomena, such as holography, appear to be convenient topics for m-Learning. They can be approached with simple examples and experiments within the cell phones performances and classroom accessibility.

The proposed system is composed of three processes: information acquisition of real objects, generation of multi-directional elemental image sets, and reconstruction of 3D images by using multidirectional projections scheme. To implement this system, depth and color (RGB) information of each object point are captured by a depth camera; then, a dynamic algorithm and GPU parallel processing are used for generating multidirectional elemental image sets to be illuminated in different directions as well as to maintain a real-time processing seed; and finally, 3D images are reconstructed by using a time-multiplexed multi-directional projection scheme through an appropriate optical setup of a projection-type integral image system. Multi-directional illuminations of elemental image sets enhance the optical ray divergence of reconstructed 3D images according to the directional projection angles. Hence, a real-time integral imaging system with enhanced viewing angle is achieved.},

An improved and efficient system for faster computation of Elemental Image generation for real time integral imaging 3D display system with the assistance of Graphics Processing Unit parallel processing is proposed. Previously implemented systems for real time integral imaging system had a resulting frame rate greater than 30 fps for elemental image generation. But this improved and more efficient system is able to produce elemental image at a rate greater than 65 fps for real time integral imaging system. Our proposed model consists of the following steps: information acquisition of objects in real time using Kinect sensor, generation of elemental image sets using pixel mapping algorithm using GPU parallel processing for faster generation. To implement this system, firstly the color (RGB) and depth information data of each object point is acquired from the depth camera (Kinect sensor). Using acquired information, we create the elemental image sets using pixel mapping algorithm. And finally we implemented the pixel mapping algorithm in GPU and hence the overall computational speed of the real time integral display system increased surprisingly. This remarkable increase in speed for elemental image generation opens up new field of possibilities for improvement in integral imaging technology i.e. merging this system with multi-directional projection for real time integral imaging system can enhance the viewing angle remarkably and so on.},

abstract = {In this paper, a computer-generated hologram (CGH) generation method is proposed to increase the field of view (FOV) in the holographic display. The CGH is generated through accumulating interference patterns of all object points. The size of each interference pattern is equal to the sum of the size of the recorded object and the spatial light modulator (SLM), so the size of the interference pattern is increased. The position of the interference pattern is related to that of the corresponding recorded object point. In the reconstruction process, three SLMs in a planar configuration are used to load the CGH. The seams between the SLMs are eliminated by beam splitters. Meanwhile, the boundaries of the diffraction light of all interference patterns are parallel with each other. Compared with the holographic display method using one SLM, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the demand for viewing distance and expand the FOV obviously in the horizontal direction, especially for the large-sized recorded object. },

In addition, a simple approach for occlusion culling is introduced. The computation time is reduced by thousands of times compared to point-based method. Discussion results show that the proposed method is more effective for larger models, and for models with huge number of points, the computation efficiency can be further enhanced by choosing larger layer spacing and optimized classification method.

abstract = {When a hologram is desired from an object which does not exist physically but is known in mathematical terms, one can compute the hologram. An automatic plotter will make a drawing at a large scale which is then reduced photographically. Since the drawing can contain only black and white areas, we have developed a theory for binary holograms. They are equivalent in terms of image reconstruction with ordinary holograms. This has been proven theoretically and verified experimentally. },

abstract = {The amount of heavy computation in Computer Generated Hologram (CGH) can be significantly reduced by pre-computing look-up tables. However, the huge memory usage of look-up tables is a major challenge. To address this problem, the Look-up tables can be efficiently compressed by methods such as radial symmetric interpolation. In this paper, we notice that there is still data redundancy in the look-up table of radial symmetric interpolation method and the table size can be further compressed to 5{\%}-10{\%} or even less of original, by our proposed mini look-up table approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The compressed look-up table in our scheme only occupies a memory size of around 200-300 KB or even less. Moreover, the proposed scheme will introduce almost no extra cost of computation speed slowdown and reconstructed image quality degradation, compared to conventional method. },

The layer-based angular spectrum with silhouette mask culling is used to calculate the wave propagations from the layers to the CGH plane without paraxial approximation. The algorithm is compatible with the computer graphics pipeline for photorealistic rendering and robust for CGHs with different parameters.

To solve these problems, an improved look-up table (LUT) method suitable for arbitrarily sampled object points is proposed and implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU) whose reconstructed object quality is consistent with that of the coherent ray-trace (CRT) method. The concept of distance factor is defined, and the distance factors are pre-computed off-line and stored in a look-up table. The results show that while reconstruction quality close to that of the CRT method is obtained, the on-line computation time is dramatically reduced compared with the LUT method on the GPU and the memory usage is lower than that of the novel-LUT considerably. Optical experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. },

It is shown that construction of the hologram constitutes a sequence of three well-known operations: a modulation, a frequency dispersion, and a square-law detection. In the reconstruction process, the inverse-frequency-dispersion operation is carried out. The process as normally carried out results in a reconstruction in which the signal-to-noise ratio is unity.
